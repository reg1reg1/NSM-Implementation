# NSM-Implementation

## Overview
Implementing various aspects of Network Security Monitoring, Incident response and understanding effectiveness of implementation depending on various types of netwoorks and sensor configuration.
The results of trying out this implementation against increasingly aware adversaries to see how well the implemented network is able to detect and prevent attacks as they happen.
An extension of the project is to use honeypots to collect data on an infected system and feeding it to the centralized machine for better zeroing in on the attacker.

The aim here is to implement efficiently NSM in practice with minimal set of resources while analyzing the resource use and efficiency of various tools
in detecting and preventing various kinds of attack. 

## Tools/Technologies used
- SiLk Toolset (Flow Collection)
- YAF (Flow generation)
- GNS3
- Logstash
- Security Onion
- Elasticsearch
- Kibana

##Application Collection Framework
This is a framework which mentions and specifies a 3-step process for collecting and storing data. The major goals identified by the application framework are as follows.

- Define and Identify threats
- Quantify Risk
- Identify Data feeds
- Narrow focus
